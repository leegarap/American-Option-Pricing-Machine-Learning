# American Option Pricing Machine Learning
This is an individual project for CFRM 421/521 class at the University of Washington. 


Note that this project is not academically peer-reviewed and for educational purpose only. So, use it as your own risk.


In this project, I trained diverse machine learning models on American option pricing data to price American option prices.
